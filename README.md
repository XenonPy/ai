# XenonPy/ai

A collection of AI examples and implementations.

## Examples

1. [Linear Regression](#linear-regression)
1. [Polynomial Regression](#polynomial-regression)

## `headless.py` VS `main.py`

The headless version is lighter weight, and doesn't require matplotlib to be installed. However, unlike the main version, it doesn't show an informative plot detailing a bit more about how the model works.

### Linear Regression

This example takes in an x-array and a y-array and correlates them with a linear regression. This example is debatably machine _learning_ in and of itself, but if not it's certainly a close neighbor and predecessor.A linear regression works well with data that follows a relatively linear path.

### Polynomial Regression

This example takes in an x-array and a y-array and correlates them with a polynomial regression. This example is debatably machine _learning_ in and of itself, but if not it's certainly a close neighbor and predecessor. A polynomial regression works like a linear one, but is capable of fitting more complex nonlinear data.
