## Examples

1. [Linear Regression](#linear-regression)
1. [Polynomial Regression](#polynomial-regression)

### Linear Regression

This example takes in an x-array and a y-array and correlates them with a linear regression. This example is not machine _learning_ in and of itself, but a close neighbor and predecessor. A linear regression works well with data that follows a relatively linear path.

### Polynomial Regression

This example takes in an x-array and a y-array and correlates them with a polynomial regression. This example is not machine _learning_ in and of itself, but a close neighbor and predecessor. A polynomial regression works like a linear one, but is capable of fitting more complex nonlinear data.
