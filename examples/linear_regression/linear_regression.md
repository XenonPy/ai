# Linear Regression (Simple)

This example takes in an x-array and a y-array and correlates them with a linear regression. This example is not machine _learning_ in and of itself, but a close neighbor and predecessor.

## Parameters

`x [array[int]]`: List of independent values for the regression to be created with.

`y [array[int]]`: The dependent variable (variable to be correlated with x).
