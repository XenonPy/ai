# Polynomial Regression

This example takes in an x-array and a y-array and correlates them with a polynomial regression. This example is debatably machine _learning_ in and of itself, but if not it's certainly a close neighbor and predecessor. A polynomial regression works like a linear one, but is capable of fitting more complex nonlinear data.

## Parameters

`x [array[int]]`: List of independent values for the regression to be created with.

`y [array[int]]`: The dependent variable (variable to be related with x).
